# Single-cycle-MIPS


# MIPS 32-bit Processor Project

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a simplified **32-bit MIPS single-cycle processor** using Verilog HDL.
The processor is capable of executing a small subset of MIPS instructions such as **ADD**, **SUB**, **AND**, **LW**, **SW**, **BEQ**, and **ADDI**.
The design was developed and simulated using **Vivado** and follows the classical single-cycle MIPS architecture structure.

## 🧠 Architecture

The processor architecture consists of the following major modules:

1. **Program Counter (PC)** – Holds the address of the next instruction.
2. **Instruction Memory** – Stores program instructions.
3. **Control Unit** – Generates control signals based on opcode and function fields.
4. **Register File** – Contains 32 general-purpose 32-bit registers.
5. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
6. **Data Memory** – Handles load and store operations.
7. **Branch Logic** – Implements conditional branching based on ALU zero signal.

The modules are interconnected in the **top-level module (`mips_cpu.v`)**, which coordinates instruction fetching, decoding, execution, memory access, and write-back.

## 📚 Theoretical Overview

The MIPS processor is a **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** architecture that emphasizes:

* Simple, fixed-length 32-bit instructions
* Load/store architecture
* Three instruction types (R-type, I-type, J-type)
* Register-based computation with few addressing modes

**Instruction execution flow:**

1. **Instruction Fetch** – PC provides address to Instruction Memory.
2. **Decode** – Control unit interprets opcode/funct fields.
3. **Execute** – ALU performs the desired operation.
4. **Memory Access** – Data memory accessed if needed.
5. **Write-Back** – Result stored back to register file.

The control unit determines the values of:

* `RegDst`, `ALUSrc`, `MemtoReg`, `RegWrite`, `MemRead`, `MemWrite`, `Branch`, and `ALUControl`.

## 🧩 Simulation Results

### Testbench: `mips_cpu_tb.v`

The testbench initializes the processor, toggles the clock, and displays register and memory contents after execution.

**Key Simulation Steps:**

* Reset asserted for 15 ns
* Clock toggled every 5 ns
* Instruction memory preloaded with a small MIPS program
* Register and data memory contents displayed after 600 ns

**Expected Output (example):**

```
>> CPU running...
R[0] = 00000000
R[1] = 0000000A
R[2] = 00000003
R[3] = 0000000D
R[4] = 00000007
R[5] = 0000000F
MEM[0] = 0000000D
MEM[1] = DEADBEEF
...
Simulation finished.
```

## 🧱 Physical Design

In the physical design stage, the synthesized Verilog modules can be implemented on FPGA or ASIC platforms.

**FPGA Implementation (Vivado):**

* Target Device: Xilinx Artix-7 (xc7a35ticsg324-1L)
* Synthesis Tool: Vivado 2023.1
* Simulation Tool: Vivado Simulator / ModelSim

**Post-synthesis Reports:**

* LUT Utilization
* Flip-Flop Count
* Timing Summary (Slack, Delay)
* Power Analysis (Dynamic + Leakage)

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

* Single-cycle architecture → all instructions take the same cycle time (slow for memory ops)
* No pipelining → lower throughput compared to multi-cycle/pipelined MIPS
* Limited instruction set (for simplicity)
* No hazard detection or forwarding mechanisms

## 🏗️ Complete ASIC Design

For ASIC design flow:

1. **RTL Design:** Verilog modules written and verified
2. **Synthesis:** RTL → gate-level netlist
3. **Floorplanning:** Define chip area and power distribution
4. **Placement:** Positioning of standard cells
5. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):** Clock signal balancing
6. **Routing:** Interconnects between cells
7. **DRC/LVS Checks:** Design rule and layout vs schematic verification
8. **Tape-out:** Final GDSII generation for fabrication
